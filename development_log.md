# Development Log

## 11/22
### Goals for the week

For this week, our group plans on beginning to parse the dataset, and creating necessary data structures to store data.

### Progress
During this week, due to conflicting schedules over break, we were unable to make any substanial progress on this week's goals.

## 11/29
### Goals for the week

For this week, our group plans on catching up on the previous week's objectives, as well as completing one traversal algorithm (BFS) and one graph algorithm.

### Progress
During this week, our group was able to build necessary data structures (node struct and graph class) to store our data, parse our data set and store this in our data structures, and implement the BFS traversal algorithm.

## 12/6 
### Goals for the week

For this week, our group plans on completing the shortest path algorithm and visualization implementation, writing sufficient test cases to test our code, and outlining the written report and presentation.

### Progress
We have finished the graph visualization algorithm, as it now presents an image of the graph of San Francisco road networks. As of now, we are still working on tests, as well as the shortest path algorithm.
